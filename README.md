### Lessons Learned
The Social Mountain Project was to create a social media platform to test my skills of Sequelize, Express API's, NodeJS and REST. The goal for this project was to learn how to combine the front-end and the back-end with a server and database. I learned about JWT's (JSON Web Tokens) and how those are created and used for authentication. It was interesting to learn and implement JWT's by having client's input their credientals through forms like a 'username' and 'password' field and having those sent to the server through HTTP requests, the JWT is created and passed back to the browser and then would be sent back to the server for verification. There is still a lot to learn but having been exposed to these great tools is helpful and exciting!
